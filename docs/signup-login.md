Why do I have to sign up?

Data lineage & collaboration need a user identity: Who modified which data when? Who shares this with me?

Signing up takes 1 min.

We do _not_ store any of your data, but only basic metadata about you (email address, etc.) & your LaminDB instances (S3 bucket names, etc.).

On the command line, run:

- `lamin signup <email>`
- `lamin login <handle>`
