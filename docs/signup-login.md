Why do I have to sign up?

- Data lineage requires a user identity (who modified which data when?).
- Collaboration requires a user identity (who shares this with me?).

Signing up takes 1 min.

We do _not_ store any of your data, but only basic metadata about you (email address, etc.) & your LaminDB instances (S3 bucket names, etc.).

- Sign up: `lamin signup <email>`
- Log in: `lamin login <handle>`
