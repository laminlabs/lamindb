Why do I have to sign up? â†’ Data flow needs a user identity to answer questions like: Who modified which data when? Who shares this with me?

[Signing up](https://lamin.ai/signup-form) takes 1 min. After that, you can log in through the command line: `lamin login <email> --password <password>`

```{note}

Lamin does _not_ store or see any of your data, but only _basic_ metadata about you (email address, etc.) & your LaminDB instances (S3 bucket names, etc.): see the [open-source client](https://github.com/laminlabs/lamindb-setup) & the [privacy policy](https://lamin.ai/legal/privacy-policy).
