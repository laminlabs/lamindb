- Each page in this guide is a Jupyter Notebook, which you can download [here](https://github.com/laminlabs/lamindb/tree/main/docs/guide).
- You can run these notebooks in hosted versions of JupyterLab, e.g., [Saturn Cloud](https://github.com/laminlabs/run-lamin-on-saturn), Google Vertex AI, and others.
- We recommend using [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) for best notebook tracking experience.
