# Guide

Welcome to the LaminDB guide! ðŸ‘‹

_Curate, store, track, query, integrate, and learn from biological data._

LaminDB provides distributed data management in which users collaborate on _LaminDB instances_.

Each _LaminDB instance_ is a [data lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse) that manages indexed **object storage** (local directories, S3, GCP) with a mapped **SQL query database** (SQLite, Postgres, and soon, BigQuery).

This is analogous to how developers collaborate on code in repositories, but unlike git and dvc, LaminDB is **queryable by entities**.

```{warning}

Public beta: Currently only recommended for collaborators as we still make breaking changes.
