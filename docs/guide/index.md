# Guide

Welcome to LaminDB ðŸ‘‹

```{warning}

Public beta: Currently only recommended for collaborators as we still make breaking changes.

```

```{tip}

Each page in this guide is a Jupyter Notebook, which you can download [here](https://github.com/laminlabs/lamindb/tree/main/docs/guide).

You can run these notebooks in hosted versions of JupyterLab:

- SaturnCloud allows you to [run the entire guide](https://github.com/laminlabs/run-lamin-on-saturn)
- Google Vertex AI works with [interactive nbproject](https://lamin.ai/docs/nbproject/faq/setup)
- LaminDB and nbproject run anywhere - just nbproject's interactive features require a tested Jupyter installation

```
