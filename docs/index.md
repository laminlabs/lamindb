Interactively curate, store, track, query, and learn from biological data across users and organizations.

Speak SQL & pydata, embrace biological entities & data provenance, and migrate data models & backends with ease.

Features:

- Query by & track data provenance on the pipeline- & data-science-level using [nbproject](https://lamin.ai/nbproject).
- Integrate data across organizations & users by virtue of universal backends and IDs.
- Easily migrate the default schema to whatever you need. Migrate storage & database backends with ease.
- Ingest any data file from any measurement device and receive guidance for integrating and querying it.
- Built for the alternating cycle of learning from data and querying data across measured → relevant → derived features.
- Track everything with a full access log: Never lose anything again, fix corrupted data without breaking results, and get rid of unused data.

Upcoming features:

- Query by & standardize against [Bionty](https://lamin.ai/bionty) to avoid semantic mess & data silos through ad hoc conventions.
- Balance pragmatic, fast-paced R&D iterations and robustness by allowing partial annotations combined with quality & integrity flags.
