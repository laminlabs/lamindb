# lamindb: Manage _files_

Data management for computational biology. From managing files to managing data.

Biology can't get rid of files entirely: biological systems will continue to be characterized by measurement devices.

- `lamindb` allows you to interactively curate, store, track & query biological data from obscure files to a biological data warehouse.
- It's designed balancing pragmatic, fast-paced R&D operations and robustness, with the needs of the data scientist in mind.
- It's a great basis for building analytics workflows & and any sort of applications on top!

Currently, the guides & API are in early private beta, heavily re-worked on a weekly basis, and hence yet lack any pedagogics.
