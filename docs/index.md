# lamindb: From managing files to managing data

Biology can't get rid of files entirely: biological systems will continue to be characterized by measurement devices.

Hence, `lamindb` allows you to interactively & iteratively curate, store, track & query biological data starting out with obscure files, and ending with a clean & robust biological data warehouse.

- Designed balancing pragmatic, fast-paced R&D operations and robustness, with data scientist needs in mind.
- Standardize against [Bionty](https://lamin.ai/bionty) to avoid data silos through ad hoc conventions.
- Maintain a mixed in-house & open schema, partial annotations, and annotates data with curation flags.
- Integrate data science workflows using [nbproject](https://lamin.ai/nbproject), to track human-level data provenance.

Build your learning & analytics workflows and any application on top!

Currently, the guides & API are in early private beta, heavily re-worked on a weekly basis, and hence yet lack any pedagogics.
