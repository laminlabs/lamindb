"""A data framework for biology.

LaminDB helps you manage data batches with two basic registries:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   Artifact
   Collection

Four registries track provenance of data batches:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   Transform
   Run
   User
   Storage

Three registries validate & contextualize:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   ULabel
   Feature
   FeatureSet

You can also access data directly via paths:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   UPath

Functions:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   track
   view
   save

Modules & settings:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   settings
   setup
   dev
