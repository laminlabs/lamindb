"""A data framework for biology.

We assume that data is stored as files or in array formats like parquet, zarr,
HDF5, TileDB or DuckDB.

LaminDB helps you manage these data with registries for metadata.

The two most important are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   File
   Dataset

Four registries track provenance of data batches:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   Transform
   Run
   User
   Storage

Four registries validate & contextualize data batches:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   ULabel
   Feature
   FeatureSet
   Modality

Functional tools:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   track
   view
   save

Static classes & modules:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   settings
   setup
   dev
