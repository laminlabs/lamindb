"""Open-source data platform for biology.

LaminDB helps you manage data using registries for metadata.
The two most central are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   File
   Dataset

Four registries track provenance of data batches:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   Transform
   Run
   User
   Storage

Four registries validate & contextualize data batches:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   Label
   Feature
   FeatureSet
   Modality

Functional tools:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   track
   view
   save

Static classes & modules:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   settings
   setup
   schema
   dev
