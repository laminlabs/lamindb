    Note:

        This is a much faster than saving records using ``record.save()``.

    Warning:

        Bulk saving neither automatically creates related records nor updates
        existing records! Use ``record.save()`` for these use cases.

    Args:
        records: Multiple :class:`~lamindb.dev.Registry` objects.
        ignore_conflicts: If ``True``, do not error if some records violate a
           unique or another constraint. However, it won't inplace update the id
           fields of records. If you need records with ids, you need to query
           them from the database.

    Examples:

        Save a collection of records in one transaction, which is much faster
        than writing a loop over ``projects.save()``:

        >>> labels = [ln.ULabel(f"Label {i}") for i in range(10)]
        >>> ln.save(projects)

        For a single record, use ``record.save()``:

        >>> transform = ln.Transform(name="My pipeline")
        >>> transform.save()

        Update a single existing record:

        >>> transform = ln.filter(ln.Transform, uid="0Cb86EZj").one()
        >>> transform.name = "New name"
        >>> transform.save()
