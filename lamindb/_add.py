    """Insert or update data records.

    Inserts a new :term:`record` if the corresponding row doesn't exist.
    Updates the corresponding row with the record if it exists.

    To update a row, query it with `.select` and modify it before
    passing it to `add`.

    Args:
        record: One or multiple records as instances of `SQLModel`.

    Returns:
        The record as returned from the database with a `created_at` timestamp.

    Examples:

        Add a record (errors if already exists):

        >>> ln.add(ln.Transform(name="My pipeline"))
        Transform(id="0Cb86EZj", name="My pipeline", ...)

        Update an existing record:

        >>> transform = ln.select(ln.Transform, id="0Cb86EZj").one()
        >>> transform.name = "New name"
        >>> ln.add(transform)
